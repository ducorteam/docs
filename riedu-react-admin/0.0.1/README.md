### Getting Started

Firstly, a huge thanks for purchasing this theme, your support is truly appreciated!

This document covers the installation and use of this theme and often reveals answers to common problems and issues - read this document thoroughly if you are experiencing any difficulties. If you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this document, feel free to email at [suppot@ducor.net](mailto:__EMAIL__) Thank you so much!

##### Main Dependencies
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes the following:

#### 1 . Node.js 
[Node Js](https://nodejs.org) is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Since our project uses JavaScript, Node.js is required to build and run the application.

Install Node.js using downloaded file.

To check your node version, run node -v in a terminal/console window & Ensure that you have Node.js (v16 or higher)
  ```bash
  node -v
npm -v
  ```

### 2 . pnpm
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io) is a fast and efficient package manager for Node.js projects. It manages and installs libraries your project depends on. pnpm is more performant and disk space-saving compared to npm or yarn.

`pnpm` is a fast and disk space-efficient package manager for managing dependencies in JavaScript projects. It helps with installing, updating, configuring, and removing dependencies, allowing you to reach your goals more quickly and with fewer distractions.

> **Note**: Unlike most other package managers that delegate non-install-related commands to other tools, `pnpm` reimplements all commands to have full control over the developer experience and stability.

- Once you have Node.js and npm installed, You also need pnpm installed globally. If you do not have pnpm,Install pnpm globally using npm: 
```bash
pnpm install -g pnpm
```
Verify Yarn installation with:
```bash
pnpm -v
```
For better understanding Vue we suggest you to once go through official documentation of Pnpm from [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io)

#### Add a New Package with `pnpm`
