####  Project Installation 
Ensure that you have Node.js (v16 or higher) installed on your system. To verify your Node.js version, run the following command:
```bash
node -v
```
You also need pnpm installed globally. If you do not have pnpm, install it using the following command:
```bash
pnpm install -g pnpm
```
Verify Yarn installation with:
```bash
pnpm -v
```
1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   cd ru-edu
   ```

  Yarn is an established open-source package manager used to manage dependencies in JavaScript projects. It assists with the process of 
  installing, updating, configuring, and removing packages dependencies, eventually helping you reach your objectives faster with fewer 
  distractions.

 > **Note**: Unlike most other package managers, which typically defer to pnpm for non-install-related commands, pnpm reimplements all 
 commands, so as to have full control over our developer experience and stability. 
 **Install Dependencies:**
 ```bash
 pnpm install
 ```
 **Start Development Server:** This command starts the development server, enabling you to preview changes live in your browser. By 
     default, the server runs at `http://localhost:3000/`.
 ```bash
    pnpm run dev
  ```

####  Performance
- **Vite-powered** for instant hot module replacement
- **Code splitting** for optimized loading
- **Production-ready** builds with minification
