###  Project Installation 
Before running the project, you need to install a few essential tools:

1. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Since our project uses JavaScript, Node.js is required to build and run the application.

- ðŸ”— **Download Node.js:** [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) pre-installed.

Ensure that you have Node.js (v16 or higher) installed on your system. To verify your Node.js version, run the following command:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
2. pnpm is a fast and efficient package manager for Node.js projects. It manages and installs libraries your project depends on. pnpm is more performant and disk space-saving compared to npm or yarn.


- Once you have Node.js and npm installed, You also need pnpm installed globally. If you do not have pnpm,Install pnpm globally using npm: 
```bash
pnpm install -g pnpm
```
Verify Yarn installation with:
```bash
pnpm -v
```
1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project folder.
   ```bash
   cd ru-edu
   ``` 
3.  Run the following commands to set up the project:

`pnpm` is a fast and disk space-efficient package manager for managing dependencies in JavaScript projects. It helps with installing, updating, configuring, and removing dependencies, allowing you to reach your goals more quickly and with fewer distractions.

> **Note**: Unlike most other package managers that delegate non-install-related commands to other tools, `pnpm` reimplements all commands to have full control over the developer experience and stability.

 **Install Dependencies:**
 ```bash
 pnpm install
 ```
 **Start Development Server:** This command starts the development server, enabling you to preview changes live in your browser. By 
     default, the server runs at `http://localhost:3000/`.
 ```bash
    pnpm run dev
  ```
### Add a New Package with `pnpm`

To add a new package to your project, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm add <package-name>

```

####  Performance
- **Vite-powered** for instant hot module replacement
- **Code splitting** for optimized loading
- **Production-ready** builds with minification


###  Build for Production  

To build the project for production, use:  

```bash
pnpm run build
```

####  Clean Up  

To remove the `node_modules` folder and clean your project, run:  

```bash
pnpm run clean
```
