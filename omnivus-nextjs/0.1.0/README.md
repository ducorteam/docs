#### ‚öõÔ∏è Project Installation 
Ensure that you have Node.js (v16 or higher) installed on your system. To verify your Node.js version, run the following command:
```bash
node -v
```
You also need Yarn installed globally. If you do not have Yarn, install it using the following command:
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```
Verify Yarn installation with:
```bash
yarn -v
```
1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project folder.
   ```bash
   cd omnivus-nextjs
   ``` 
3.  Run the following commands to set up the project:
  Yarn is an established open-source package manager used to manage dependencies in JavaScript projects. It assists with the process of 
  installing, updating, configuring, and removing packages dependencies, eventually helping you reach your objectives faster with fewer 
  distractions.
 > **Note**: Unlike most other package managers, which typically defer to npm for non-install-related commands, Yarn reimplements all 
 commands, so as to have full control over our developer experience and stability. 
 **Install Dependencies:**
 ```bash
  yarn
 ```
 **Start Development Server:** This command starts the development server, enabling you to preview changes live in your browser. By 
     default, the server runs at `http://localhost:3000/`.
 ```bash
    yarn run dev
  ```
**Key Features of** `**yarn run dev**`**:**
 *   Watches for file changes and updates the browser in real-time.      
 *   Provides detailed error messages during development.
 *   Optimized for fast feedback and iteration.

### üõ†Ô∏è Customization
#### Change Site Title 
To change the site title, open the project in your editor and edit the `next.config.js` file or use the `Head` component in the pages where needed:
##### Method 1: Global Title
 Modify the Site Title in `next.config.js`
1. Open the project in your editor.
2. Edit the `next.config.js` file.
3. Update the `title` property inside the `head` configuration.
Example:
```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  head: {
    title: 'My Awesome Site',  // Set the global title here
    meta: [
      {
        name: 'description',
        content: 'This is an awesome Next.js site!'  // Optional description
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
##### Method 2: Individual Pages
If you want to set a specific title for individual pages, you can use the `Head` component from `next/head`:
1. Open or create the page where you want to change the title (e.g., `pages/index.js`).
2. Import the `Head` component from `next/head`.
3. Add a `<title>` tag inside the `Head` component for each page.
Example:
```jsx
// pages/index.js
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Home - My Awesome Site</title>  {/* Page-specific title */}
        <meta name="description" content="Welcome to the homepage of My Awesome Site!" />
      </Head>
      <h1>Welcome to My Awesome Site!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
#### Update the Favicon
To update the favicon for your site, follow these steps:
1. Replace the `favicon.ico` file in the `public/` directory with your desired favicon file.
2. Next.js automatically serves the favicon from the `public/` directory, and it will be used across all pages.
File Structure:
```plaintext
public/
  favicon.ico  // Your updated favicon file
```
