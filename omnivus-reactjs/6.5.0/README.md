#### ‚öõÔ∏è Project Installation 
Ensure that you have Node.js (v16 or higher) installed on your system. To verify your Node.js version, run the following command:
```bash
node -v
```
You also need Yarn installed globally. If you do not have Yarn, install it using the following command:
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```
Verify Yarn installation with:
```bash
yarn -v
```
1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project folder.
   ```bash
   cd omnivus-reactjs

3.  Run the following commands to set up the project:

  Yarn is an established open-source package manager used to manage dependencies in JavaScript projects. It assists with the process of 
  installing, updating, configuring, and removing packages dependencies, eventually helping you reach your objectives faster with fewer 
  distractions.

 > **Note**: Unlike most other package managers, which typically defer to npm for non-install-related commands, Yarn reimplements all 
 commands, so as to have full control over our developer experience and stability. 
 **Install Dependencies:**
 ```bash
  yarn
 ```
 **Start Development Server:** This command starts the development server, enabling you to preview changes live in your browser. By 
     default, the server runs at `http://localhost:3000/`.
 ```bash
    yarn run dev
  ```
**Key Features of** `**yarn run dev**`**:**
    
 *   Watches for file changes and updates the browser in real-time.      
 *   Provides detailed error messages during development.
 *   Optimized for fast feedback and iteration.
